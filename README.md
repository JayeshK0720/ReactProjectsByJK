🗂️ Notes App

A modern and minimal React-based interface designed for document card display. This is a basic prototype with a clean UI, created to simulate how document upload and download might look in a production app.

##✨ Features

📄 Stylish card-based layout to visually represent each document.
💡 Placeholder buttons for Download and Upload actions (non-functional for now).
❌ Functional delete (or close) icon.
📁 File size indication per card.

Responsive and dark-themed design for better readability.

⚠️ Note: Download and Upload buttons are currently just UI placeholders — functionality will be added in the future.


##⚙️ Tech Stack

React.js – For component-based UI
Tailwind CSS – For utility-first responsive styling
Font Awesome – Icon library for UI elements
Vite – Fast build tool and development server
